# OOP_Cpp_Project

This system is about gym management. Basically, the user can add trainee/intructor/exerice machine, set a gym license validation, print gym info.
The system is designed according to the following instructions:

a. 10 classes
b. 3 inheritances at least one as multiple
c. 2 classes with dynamic allocations
d. 2 classes with arrays
e. at least 5 operators an addition to the operator =
f. 8 actions in the menu
g. write a generic linked list using templates. Only adding a member to the end, deleting a member should be supported and printing. Do not use ready-made types of the STL in this implementation.
h. Use the list you created in the previous section to replace one of the arrays defined in the code. third. Replace all dynamically assigned char* type fields in the string class
i. Replace the use of arrays with the use of the STL vector (except for the array you changed in section B).
j. Add an addition to the story so that it includes the use of 3 design patterns.
